This project is running at [Here](https://nanosando.github.io/maple-reverse/). 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Trained by modifying Othello AI from https://github.com/suragnair/alpha-zero-general

Training code is [Here](https://github.com/nanosando/maple-reverse-ai)

Only difference is 5 random holes on the board that cannot put anything. And also corresponding logic was added.

Modified python code to Javascript.
